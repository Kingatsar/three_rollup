Two origami birds and one dragon have gone missing in your room... But pay attention, because each of them is singing. To get a better view, pop the various obstacles (geometries) by touching them. You will have about 3 minutes to find all three beings before their songs stop.

It is strongly advised to use headphones for a better experience.
